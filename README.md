# see the code if you are in mood :)

# this project has two phases:  phase 1 and phase 2

# phase 1  :
    problem 1:
       Design and implement a system that receives the Deterministic Finite Acceptor (DFA) specification from the input file and checks whether the strings entered by the user are 
       accepted or not in the DFA. It is worth mentioning that it should receive the string from the program input as well as the receiver in the format of the DFA_Input_1.txt file, the 
       structure of this file is mentioned in the implementation description. In addition, as an example of DFA, there is a file with the same name in the folder of this project.

    problem 2:
       Design and implement a system that converts non-deterministic finite acceptor (NFA) into deterministic finite acceptor (DFA). The NFA receives the input in the format of the 
       NFA_Input_2.txt file and produces the output DFA in the format of the DFA_Output _2.txt file, the structure of these files is mentioned in the implementation description. In 
       addition, as an example of NFA, there is a file called NFA_Input_2.txt in the folder of this project.

    problem 3:
       Design and implement a system that converts the regular expression into a non-deterministic finite acceptor (NFA). Receive the input regular expression in the RE_Input_3.txt file 
       format and generate the output NFA in the NFA_Output _2.txt file format, the structure of these files is mentioned in the implementation description. In addition, as an example 
       of a regular expression, there is a file called RE_Input_3.txt in the folder of this project.
       The input format for the regular expression is as follows:
       The first line contains the letters of the alphabet, separated by a space.
       In the second line, the desired regular expression is written and we use ^ for power


# phase 2  : 
     Design a system that uses the Turing machine function:
               𝑓(𝑥)={ 𝑥 𝑚𝑜𝑑 4 for 𝑥≥20
                3𝑥+5 for 𝑥<20}

      Turing maching should be like this:

      the output should be like these:
